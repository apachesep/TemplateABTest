Template A/B Test
=================

This Joomla 3.x system plugin allows you to perform A/B tests for templates.
Within the plugin configuration you can choose 2 template styles (pro tip: don't choose the same style).

When a visitor comes to your site the plugin randomly chooses one of the two styles.
It then shows the website in the chosen template style and maintains this during the visit session by setting a session variable with the chosen template style.

Warning: if this plugin is active, all assigned template styles are ignored! All your pages will be show in the chosen template style.

Installation instructions:
* Download the installer file from the releases page.
